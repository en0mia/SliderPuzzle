<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While I was studying for my Algorithms course I faced this fascinating assignment and I decided to share my implementation of the A* algorithm.

I firstly implemented it following the course's requirements (with their own libraries and implementations), then I decided to refactor my code in order to use the standard Java libraries.
